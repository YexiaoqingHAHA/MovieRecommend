CF:

Recommendations
---------------(which are not in this rated movies)

We have done a qualitative analysis of the movies recommended by the Collaborative Filter model.
We calculated the user biases and overall average rating. We used the sum of the two values as the threshold 
for deciding which movies the user "liked". Some of the genres of the movies that came up after filtering with the 
threshold were:

horror sci-fi
drama thriller
drama horror
action drama scifi thriller
action adventure scifi
comedy romance drama

And some of the recommendations that the Collaborative Filtering model came up with were:

adventure
drama mystery crime
action thriller adventure
animation children fantasy musical

We can see from these recommended genres that although Collaborative Filtering makes relevant recommendations, 
it does not seem to be able to recommend movies of widely different genres. For example, in this case, although the user 
seemed to like comedy, romance and drama movies, Collaborative Filtering did not seem to be recommending these kinds of movies.
We found this to be a general pattern in the recommendations made by Collaborative Filtering.

On the other hand, Collaborative Topic Regression did not seem to suffer from this problem. One of the examples we found was in 
a case where the user "liked" a set of movies of these genres:

comedy drama romance
comedy drama
drama romance
drama
action thriller
action adventure mystery thriller
comedy
action adventure romance thriller
action drama thriller

and the genres suggested by CTR were:

drama romance
drama romance
comedy drama
comedy drama
comedy drama romance
drama romance
drama romance
drama
comedy
action adventure thriller
comedy romance
action adventure comedy romance thriller

We can see that CTR came up with a movie suggestion that combined the "likes" of the user.
The user "liked" separate action, adventure, thriller
